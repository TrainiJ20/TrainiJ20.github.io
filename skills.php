            <h1>Web Development Skills</h1>
            <p>My website, ‘Guess the Number’, presents a solution to the number guessing problem, an engaging application of the binary search algorithm. It aims to present an accurate presentation of the algorithm to solve the problem and outline of its proof of appropriate functioning. The features of my website allow for an accessible and user-friendly experience.</p>
            <p>Though the creation of my website proved initially difficult, I eventually gathered the HTML elements and techniques to accurately display the problem. I spent time to ensure that every aspect of it was of a high standard, with each page on the website edited many times to ensure its correctness. All links within the website lead to the correct destinations and appropriate naming of files make the navigation predictable.</p>
            <p>The design of my website accounts for both usability and accessibility. I included a simplistic header which provides all useful links to each page and an easier way back to home page. I have also implemented variable widths on elements to allow the website to be accessible to users with different screen sizes. This can be observed in the ‘hero’ section of the index where the image can be aesthetically displayed on both wide and narrow screens as the edges fade into the background. Additionally, many large buttons have been inserted into the bottom of each page to make navigation more accessible by being salient and along the reading path.</p>
            <p>In addition, various design choices have enabled my website to maximise its visual appeal. A standard colour pallet was implemented through the CSS allowing for the colouring on every page of the website to remain uniform. The ‘main’ CSS file enables different elements like the buttons to maintain a consistent style throughout. The use of modern sans serif fonts on the index page combined with the contrasting shades of grey and symmetrical margins effectively engages users through its aesthetic nature.</p>
            <p>Overall the high accuracy, accessibility and aesthetics of my web project are evidence of my developing skills as a web developer.</p>
